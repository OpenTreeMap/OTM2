Welcome New SJC Citizen Scientist Tree Mapper!

<p>
Thanks so much for joining the historic Jersey City Tree Mapping Census and we appreciate the time you have already put in participating in the WebEx Training we‚Äôve put together for the program.
</p>

<p>
Below are the steps to help you get started <b>Setting Up a User Account</b> with the <b>SJC OpenTreeMap (OTM) Platform</b>, so you can begin mapping Trees in your neighborhood, and the <b>GroupMe OTM Text App</b>, so you can be in touch with your Neighborhood Captain. The GroupMe OTM Text App is important to download right away so communications about the Tree Mapping Census get to you in a timely way. The GroupMe OTM Text App also helps us to field any and all questions you may have about your field mapping experience. It is your direct connect to your Neighborhood Captain.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started With The GroupMe (OTM) Text App</h3>
<p>
The GroupMe Text App will be your tool to talk, coordinate, and keep in touch with your Neighborhood Captain, Ward Captain, and Sustainable Jersey City. We are also connecting you with your fellow neighborhood Tree Mappers who have the GroupMe OTM Text App. You can send pictures, ask questions, get activated with your neighborhood!
</p>

<p>
<b>First Step</b>: Download the GroupMe App on your smartphone (Google Playstore or iPhone), so you can create an account that will allow you to connect on the OTM Network we set up in JC for GroupMe OTM Text App with other Tree Mappers in your neighborhood and your Neighborhood Captain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Second Step</b>: You will enter your specific neighborhood on the GroupMe OTM Text App via the dedicated Neighborhood Hyperlink Invite sent to you in an email from your Neighborhood Captain, so stay tuned to your inbox.
